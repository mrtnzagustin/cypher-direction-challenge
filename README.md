# Cypher direction challenge
Implementation of the Tomaz Bratanic (@tomasonjo) neo4j cypher direction competition.
Repo: https://github.com/tomasonjo/cypher-direction-competition/

# Steps
To run the solution you just need to install python and execute the main.py script in the src folder. That scripts run the query processing against every query present in the examples.csv file from the competition.

```script
python main.py
```

# Docker
If you prefer, insted of running the solution locally and having to install python, you can run the solution using the dockerization present in the repo. Also, with vscode and the Remote Container extension.

# Regex
The main approach used to implement the solution uses regular expressions. You can check the utils.py file for a better understanding, debug the code and check regex in https://regex101.com/
